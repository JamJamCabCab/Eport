                  <p>This quarter, which has been challenging for me, has presented a unique oppurtunity for my personal growth. Unlike my twin who was always considered tech-savvy by my family, I never understood coding and always despised any school activity that involved opening notepad. But the circumstances and requirements of this year has forced me to step out of my comfort zone and try my hand at coding and dabble in the complexities of web page construction.AlthoughI always get confused and disoriented when looking at big blocks of code, I know if I try harder I will get better at coding because the one thing I've learned from last year is that the worst thing I can do when faced with a problem involving academics is give up and run.</p>

                  <p>This quarter in ICT has been both challenging and rewarding. We focused on Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is essential for web design. I learned how CSS enhances the visual appeal of websites, making them more user-friendly and professional. From understanding selectors and properties to exploring layouts, colors, and responsive design, I gained a deeper appreciation for how much detail goes into creating even a simple webpage.

One of the biggest struggles I faced was understanding flexbox and grid layouts. At first, the syntax and concepts seemed overwhelming, and I found it difficult to apply them correctly in practice. Debugging CSS issues was another hurdle, as a single misplaced semicolon or incorrect property value could lead to unexpected results. However, I overcame these challenges by reviewing lessons, watching tutorials, and practicing consistently.

Another personal struggle was time management. Balancing ICT projects with other subjects and personal responsibilities required better planning and prioritization. I learned to break tasks into smaller steps and allocate specific times for them, which helped me meet deadlines without feeling overwhelmed.

On the triumph side, successfully completing a responsive website project was a highlight for me. It felt rewarding to see my designs come to life on different screen sizes, showcasing my growth in using CSS effectively. Additionally, collaborating with classmates on group activities helped me improve my teamwork and problem-solving skills.

Overall, this quarter was a period of growth and self-discovery. CSS taught me to be more detail-oriented and patient, while the struggles I faced strengthened my resilience. I am excited to continue learning and improving as we progress in ICT.</p>
